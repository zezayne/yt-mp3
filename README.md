# yt-mp3
Used to download Youtube Music Videos into mp3 without needing to use sketchy websites full of junk ads to download and pontentially getting a virus on your pc :)

Installion guide: 
1) https://www.python.org/downloads/
2) Copy the command : "py -m pip install -r requirements.txt" , if that doesn't work you might want to try : " python -m pip install -r requirements.txt" or "pip install -r requirements.txt"
